ipod is a golang userspace library implementation of the ipod accessory protocol.
It includes an example client for use with https://github.com/kanonochina/ipod-gadget

This is a total rewrite of what was included with the ipod-gadget project.
It should work as a drop-in replacement for the old app.

New features:

- Storing and replaying traces
- Detailed verbose logging for debug
- Better codebase with message type definitions
- Tests
